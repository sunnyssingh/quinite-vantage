        // Let's check if call_queue has call_id or similar. The user didn't show the schema, but usually it does.
        // To be safe, let's just update call_logs first as that's what LivePage uses for status.

        // fetchActiveCalls uses call_logs.

        // However, I don't know the schema of call_queue for sure. 
        // I previously saw `call_queue` has `status`.

        // Simplest approach: Just update call_logs for now to fix the "Active Calls" list stickiness.
